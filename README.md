# LAArtsAccessDatathon
The Arts Access Datathon will bring together local arts agencies with artists, arts administrators, educators, students, community advocates and researchers as well as other professionals in culture, museums and urban planning to address this question. Together we will explore the data that are available to find out what we know and explore what we could know. At the end of the day we will have a greater understanding of the present and future of arts and culture programming, infrastructure, and policy across the Los Angeles region. Weâ€™ll also know a whole lot more about how we can put the data to work.
