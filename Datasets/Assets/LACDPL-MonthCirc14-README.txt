Los Angeles County Library Monthly Circulation Statistics

How many books are checked out or renewed from each library every month? This dataset provides the answer, dating back to 2014. This includes County libraries only and does not include the City of LA’s library data or any of the other 36 library systems in the County.

The dataset has not been refreshed since 2015. It was originally published on the County Open Data Portal.
