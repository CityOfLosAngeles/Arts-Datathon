IMLS Main Libraries, Branches and Bookmobiels: FY 2014 Public Libraries Survey (pulled 4/10/17)

This database provides basic information about every main library, branch and bookmobile in the US. If you only want to see LA County, set the “filter” function so that COUNTY is LOS ANGELES. There are 37 library systems in LA County.

The dataset was last refreshed in January 2017. It was originally published on the Institute of Museum and Library Services Open Data Portal.
