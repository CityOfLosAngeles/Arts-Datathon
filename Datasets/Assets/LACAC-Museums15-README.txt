Los Angeles County Museums data (pulled 4/10/17)

LA County is home to at least 226 museums. This list of LA County museums is a curated subset of a crowdsourced list of museums created by the Institute of Museum and Library Services. This is the most complete list of museums in the County, but there may be other, smaller museums that are not included.

The dataset has not been refreshed since 2015. It was originally published on the County Open Data Portal.
