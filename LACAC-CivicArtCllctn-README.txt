Los Angeles County Arts Commission (LACAC)

Civic Art Collection data (pulled 4/5/17)

The County's civic art collection is comprised of artworks created by and for Los Angeles County through capital funded projects and donations.

The dataset is refreshed on a weekly basis and published via the County Open Data Portal on a bi-annual (twice a year) basis. Data are collected via EmbARK, a collections management database created and maintained by Gallery Systems.

Images are not included in the dataset, but available for non-commercial purposes by contacting Civic Art staff at civicart@arts.lacounty.gov.

Terms used in the dataset are drawn from Getty's Art and Architectural Thesaurus at http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/.

Data reported in this dataset are required to be factual based on certain acceptable forms of documentation. This means at times the data may be vague (for example, an artwork's creation date may be listed as simply 20th century) because it is the most factually-supported documentation about the artwork for that field.
